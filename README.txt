#this is a readme file

Using markup, I can make words **bold** or *italicized*.

I can make unordered lists:
- iteem a
- item b
- item c

And ordered lists:
1. first step
2. second step
3. third step

I can insert 'code' into lines of text, like 'ls'.

I can also include links, like this [one](http://coursera.com)
